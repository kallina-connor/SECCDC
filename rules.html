                      <h3>Key Policies</h3>
                      <p>In an effort to help facilitate the development of a regular, national level cyber security exercise, the Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security at the University of Texas at San Antonio hosted the first Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) for the Southwestern region in May 2005. In June 2005, members of the Kennesaw State University's Center for Information Security Education attended their presentation and recognized the value of the program. We immediately volunteered to create a similar event at KSU in 2006, to provide a regional competition to recognize the best team in the Southeast, and to work to sponsor that team to the National competition hosted by UTSA (see <a href="http://infosec.kennesaw.edu/SECCDC/www.nationalccdc.org">www.nationalccdc.org</a>).</p>
                      <p>While similar to other cyber defense competitions in many aspects, the SECCDC, as part of the CCDC, is unique in that it focuses on the operational aspect of managing and protecting an existing network infrastructure. While other exercises examine the abilities of a group of students to design, configure, and protect a network over the course of an entire semester, this competition is focused on the more operational task of assuming administrative and protective duties for an existing "commercial" network. Teams will be scored based on their ability to detect and respond to outside threats, maintain availability of existing services such as mail servers and web servers, respond to business requests such as the addition or removal of additional services, and balance security needs against business needs.</p>

                      <p>If a team does not make the top 8 teams in the SECCDQC, they are NOT eligible for a refund. If for any reason the competition is rescheduled due to events beyond the competition committee's control, all registration and sponsorship fees will be transferred to the new date.

                          <li>A competitor in their final semester prior to graduation is exempt from the full-time student requirement and may compete in CCDC events as a part-time student provided the competitor has a demonstrated record of full-time attendance for the previous semester or quarter.</li>

Teams lose points by violating service level agreements, usage of recovery services, and successful penetrations by the Red Team.</li>
                        <li>Scores will be maintained by the competition officials and may be shared at the end of the competition. There will be no running totals provided during the competition. Team rankings may be provided at the beginning of each competition day.</li>
                        <li>Any team action that interrupts the scoring system is exclusively the responsibility of that team and will result in a lower score. Any team member that modifies a competition system or system component, with or without intention, in order to mislead the scoring engine into assessing a system or service as operational, when in fact it is not, may be disqualified and/or the team assessed penalties. Should any question arise about scoring, the scoring engine, or how scoring functions, the Team Captain should immediately contact the competition officials to address the issue.</li>
                        <li>Teams are strongly encouraged to provide <strong>properly 
                          formatted </strong>incident reports for each Red Team incident they detect. Incident reports can be completed as needed throughout the competition and presented to the White Team for collection. Incident reports must contain a description of what occurred (including source and destination IP addresses, timelines of activity, passwords cracked, access obtained, damage done, etc), a discussion of what was affected, and a remediation plan. A thorough incident report that correctly identifies and addresses a successful Red Team attack <strong>may</strong> reduce the Red Team penalty for that event - no partial points will be given for incomplete or vague incident reports.

                      <p> With the advent of viable remote access technologies and virtualization, teams will have the ability to participate in CCDC events from their respective institutions. This section addresses policy for proper engagement in CCDC events for remote teams.</p>
                      <ol start="1" type="a">
                        <li>Remote teams are required to compete from a location with controlled access, i.e., a separate room or a portion of a room that is dedicated for use during the CCDC event. Workstations and internet access must comply with published requirements.</li>

                          <ol start="1" type="i">
                            <li>Be present with the participating team to assure compliance with all event rules</li>

                            <li>Assure that the Team Captain has communicated to the Event Judges approval of initial system integrity and remote system functionality</li>
                            <li>Assist Event Judges in the resolution of grievances and disciplinary action, including possible disqualification, where needed</li>
                            <li>Report excessive misconduct to local security or police</li>
                            <li>Assess completion of various injects based on timeliness and quality when requested by Event Judges</li>
                            <li>Act as a liaison to site personnel responsible for core networking and internet connectivity</li>
                            <li>Provide direct technical assistance to teams when requested by Event Judges</li>
                            <li>Provide feedback to students subsequent to the completion of the CCDC event</li>
                          </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>A recommendation for Remote Site Judge(s) is expected to be given from a Team representative of the participating institution to the CCDC Event Manager. Remote Site Judge(s) must not be currently employed, a student of, or otherwise affiliated with the participating institution, other than membership on an advisory board. CCDC Event Managers should also be apprised of a contact from the participating institution responsible for core networking and internet connectivity that will be available during the CCDC event.<br>

                        <li><em>SECCDC Supplemental Rule: The video recording of SECCDC events and event materials is prohibited without the expressed permission of the competition officials. Similarly the broadcast, publication or posting of event materials in any public forum, to include documentation and team packets before, during or after a SECCDC competition is prohibited and may result in teams being prohibited from competing in the current and/or future competition seasons. Teams and team representatives may use flash photography during the reception and closing ceremonies. We will make every effort to provide professionally recorded video during the awards portion of the final presentation, and to have an escort to allow team representatives to take photographs of their teams during the competition, at designated times.</em></li>
